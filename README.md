# College-Programs
## Goals
Our goals with this project are to:
- Learn database querying with MySQL
- Connect queries with Python
- Learn more about US colleges through the Department of Education College Scorecard database
- Create a GUI that allows users to perform custom searches over the database (work in progress)
Our deliverable (MVP) is:
- A normalized database out of the College Scorecard
- A set of queries that provide interesting information about colleges
- Matplotlib graphs to help show our findings
- A Python program that provides a GUI linked with our database (work in progress)
This project is largely inspired by this one: https://github.com/dlwhittenbury/MySQL_IMDb_Project. We took many methods from what that project did with python and connecting python with SQL. 

## Findings


## TODO:
- normalize Program_Percentages so we can look at area of study popularity
- perhaps we can use the College Scorecard API to make this work better
 - https://github.com/RTICWDT/open-data-maker/blob/master/API.md
- **Make the GUI**
